### Game Set

Game set will begin by forming an array that contains key value pairs of a word and a synonym. I'll need to set the text content of 12 buttons to be equal to the words identified, and align them in a grid. I'll need a function that chooses between these words a specific key, and presents it's pair.


### Game Play

I'll set a function to identify a button pressed as changing the player turns.

### Check for Win

I'm not sure I have need to check for a win, may need to look at the outline again. Perhaps I can log the scores in the title bar though to give the players a better idea of the sequence.

- One other idea is to have set number of incorrect answers, which the score would be more functional to log.

### Game Reset

Return to main screen.

#### Layout
- inspired by button features and mobile apps, want to switch colors between player one and two to highlight changes. Will do some research on most accessible colors/fonts for students.
