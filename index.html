            <p>Synonyms are words that have nearly the same meaning.  
                Like when we say "PE class made me exhausted." or "PE class made me tired." 
                These words have a similar meaning, and the different use doesn't change the sentence.
                You can think of synonyms as different codewords, they have the same definition without using the original.
                Today we'll play spies, and uncover the synonym of our codeword.
